== BACKGROUND ==

The purpose of this document is to explain relevant changes to developers in a way that will help them update their own customizations of BuddyPress Docs.

= 1.2 =

* TEMPLATES
	In BuddyPress Docs 1.2, the arrangement of templates was changed somewhat. A 'single' directory was introduced, and some of the single-doc templates were correspondingly deprecated in favor of new templates in the /single/ directory. Details:

	OLD TEMPLATE	moved to   NEW LOCATION
	single-doc.php		   single/index.php
	edit-doc.php		   single/edit.php
	comments.php		   single/comments.php
	history.php		   single/history.php

	The old template paths are still there, for purposes of proper deprecation. If you're creating custom templates for BPD, there's no need to copy the old templates into your theme's /docs/ directory.

* LOOP
	Previous versions of BPD used the main WP loop (query_posts(); $wp_query). This has been deprecated in 1.2 in favor of a custom loop structure:

	if ( bp_docs_has_docs() ) {
		while ( bp_docs_has_docs() ) {
			bp_docs_the_doc();
		}
	}

	If you've built custom templates, they should be updated to reflect this change.
